# rice-datathon-chevron-2023

## Project Overview
This repo contains an R script that processes and shapes training data for energy-related statistics per state over 2015-2019 and runs a multivariable regression model to determine states that are most likely to require larger amounts of investment annually. With normalizing the data, the RMSE of the model was approximately 0.809 when comparing predictions to the actual investments for states in 2020. The project also includes some data visualizations of the response plotted against select regressors.
